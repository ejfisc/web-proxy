This program is written in Python 3.11.1.
If you have python installed on your system, there are two ways to run this code.

1) Through the command line.
Open Command Prompt (CMD).
In CMD, change directory to the folder that the program is stored.
Once there, type "py webproxy.py" without the quotes to run the program.
If you changed the name of the program, update the previous instruction with the new file name.

2) Double clicking the python program.
If you have Python fully installed, your computer should recognize Python files.
Thus it will allow you to run them directly by double clicking them.

Once the proxy server is listening for requests, open your browser and navigate to 
localhost:5005/<destination address> where destination address is any website
to see the HTTP request and response data in your terminal.
